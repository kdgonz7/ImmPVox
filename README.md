Experience instant player voice playback in Garry's Mod with ImmPVox! Standing for Immediate Mode Player Voice, this addon provides immediate readiness, letting you trigger audio files without delay. It offers a versatile interface, supports many actions, and includes an extensible API for customization, all while integrating smoothly with the feel of standard VOX systems.

## Why?

Because I couldn't wrap my head around existing VOX mods. Therefore I created my own, which is simple to use and contains a spawn menu entry to make it easier for the average user to change their VOX and modify internals.

## Note For Developers

For stable development and compatibility with ImmPVox, it is essential to work with the Steam Workshop release of the PVox addon. This ensures you are using the latest **stable** build where API modifications are **properly documented**.

Please *avoid* using the unstable main (**head**) development branch. This version often lacks documentation for recent changes and may include incomplete or different features compared to the stable release ImmPVox is built upon.

## Included Modules (w/ THIS REPOSITORY)

* SCP-049
* NTF
* Combine Soldier
* Duck
* Counter-Strike: Source
* Counter-Strike 2: SAS Operator
* Counter-Strike 2: Phoenix Connexion Operator

## Credits

* PVox takes a part of it's codebase from **PLConv**, a player sound framework that's similar to PVox that was never released.
* PVox is inspired by, yet not very closely related to *TFA-VOX*, a separate VOX mod.
