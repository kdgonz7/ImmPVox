# Foreword

To begin this documentation, I'd like to start by saying that PVox is not meant to ever be a "REPLACEMENT" for specific VOX addons, all of them present their own caveats and bonuses which make them unique. That's the ideology of the Garry's Mod Workshop, is that there's many different ways to achieve the same effect, and they all have their bonuses

## Credits

* PVox is heavily inspired by and somewhat similar to TFA-VOX.
* PVox has support for TFA-VOX as well as in-the-works support for PE (Player Expressions)
