# Introduction

There hasn't been many player voice addons coming up in the past year or so, and that doesn't go without its reason. **TFA-VOX**, and even the overwhelmingly outdated *Player Expressions* mod have still dominated the legacy and modern scene, whether it be for pure fun, yet realistic game play.

PVox provides a new approach to player expression, as it is friendly for both the developers making the addon fun for the consumers, and the consumers alike.

> **Fun Fact:** PVox is inspired by TFA-VOX, and Player Expressions, and has made various attempts to support them in the past.
> If you want to, you can use multiple TFA-VOX mods that add new voices, with PVox, by installing the [PVox TFA-VOX Support Layer](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3306143018) mod.

## So Why Add Another?

Because PVox takes a differing approach to ensuring that call outs happen securely and promptly, yet not being intrusive from a consumer standpoint. This balance makes PVox very suitable for cases where VOX is desirable. Examples such as:

* Garry's Mod "Realism" Game-play
* Garry's Mod Role-play
* Garry's Mod Videos

All of these use cases are examples of where PVox can shine.

## How Do I Use It?

PVox comes with spawn-menu entries that can be found in `Options > PVOX`, these can include module settings, to PVox developer settings and internal variables, all of which can be modified, or looked at through these entries.

To change **your** preset, you can go to the `PVOX > VOX Controls` panel to change *your* preset. You can **NOT** change other players presets, only modify your own. Presets are updated in real-time and serialized via networked variables, which are predicted, therefore should remain consistent on client and servers alike, even though PVox **has a shared module system**. See ["The Shared Module System"](./shared_modules.md) for more information

> [Getting Dirty With PVox](./using_pvox.md) gives a brief overview of the PVox system for the average consumer.
